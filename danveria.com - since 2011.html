                            <p>Hello again, I hope you’re well and this finds you in a good or relaxed mood. This is the first in a multi part series on the platforms that we target, before we dive into that I should describe what we define as a platform.</p>

                            <p>So when when use the term “platform” we actually mean “Software Platform” which we define as an operating system which allows other smaller software to run  on devices, enabling said software access to hardware features.</p>

                            <p>With our definition of a platform out of the way, I’m going to give a few examples of popular platform in the marketplace and devices that they power:</p>

                            <p>We will take a close look at the platforms over the next few episodes, it is important at the outset to outline what we covering and going forward how we create cross platform media content that works well on all devices.</p>

                            <p>In the next episode will take a closer look at the Android platform, its history and the tools we can use to create games, media and apps for the platform. Thanks for your time and keep checking back for updates!</p>

                            <p>Hello, my name’s Alec and I act as an artist and level designer for Danveria, come September I’ll be attending Hallam University to study Game Design. I also currently work nights, so I hover around at weird times and sleep all day.</p>

                            <p>As a team member I do what I’m told, like a good boy and over critique everyone else’s work (often sounding unnecessarily harsh but don’t mean to) because I want to make sure we’re making only the very best stuff.</p>

                            <p>Hobbies include playing music, playing games and watching stuff (TV dramas, films, anime, western cartoons, ASMR videos… I’ll watch anything). I own 2 electric guitars, 1 acoustic, 1 electric bass and 1 ukulele, I’m below or just average at all of them.</p>

                            <p>About me, well, I am a gamer and my favourite games are from the ‘Souls’ series. I have spent way too much time playing them. I am also studying games design.</p>

                            <p>My hobbies and general interests are; Youtube, I love Youtube and what it brings to the community, I also have a channel where I post Let's Plays and pvp matches on dark souls. I am also a massive football fan and sports in general but football is the best sport going...</p>

                            <p>However supporting Liverpool makes it hard at times.</p>

                            <p>Thanks for reading my intro and I hope you have a good day </p>

                            <p>I'm currently in my second year, studying Computer Games and Animation at Doncaster University Centre. What I enjoy doing most with in this field is just creating appealing pieces of artwork.</p>

                            <p>I haven't really decided on a focus yet, I enjoy creating weapons as much as environments.</p>

                            <p>I’ll largely be involved in the reviews and media output, as well as behind the scenes activities.</p>

                            <p>Greetings!</p>

                            <p>My name is Aaron Rolph and I am the head programmer for Danveria.com. This means that it’s my job to take the team’s ideas and implement them into our games (sometimes with a tear in my eye due to the complicated nature of the requests).</p>

                            <p>I am currently a student studying at the University of Hull doing Computer Science with Games Development. I am at University every single day of the week and therefore my life only consists of code, if anyone is in the matrix it would be me! In the little spare time that I have I play video games. I play mostly on PS4 (PSN ajrthegreat) because it feels more relaxing to sit back with a controller but I also have a hefty steam library (STEAM ajrthegreat) for when I am supposed to be working. Feel free to follow me on social media (it’s pretty much always ajrthegreat due to when I was younger it was my initials and I was great!) and also follow Danveria.com to keep up to date with our games.
                            </p>

                            <p>Hi, I hope that your well and in a comfortable place when you read this. My name is Dan Welsh.  While i’m not normally the type of person to talk about myself, in fact it is one of the things I hate in interviews (Interviewer: so tell me about yourself? Me: ermmm……).</p>

                            <p>But as this is an introduction, so I should talk about myself a little (there are so many more interesting things to talk about… in upcoming posts). So here is an extract from my C.V. that describes me well:</p>

                            <blockquote>
                            <p>I am a designer and programmer. I try to look at each problem that I face with an open and clear mind, whilst trying to remain calm and helpful at all times. I have always been passionate about technology as far back as I can remember.</p>
                            <footer>From my c.v. sometime in 2015/16</footer>
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>Most importantly I don’t think I could do anything else 😉 thanks for your time and keep checking back for updates. I promise to do better in later posts which don’t talk about myself, promise 🙂</p>
